Have you ever felt like your business is a high-performance race car stuck on a
dirt road? It’s a common frustration. Your business grows, but your software
doesn't keep up. Suddenly, tasks that used to take minutes now take hours. You
find yourself fighting with rigid systems, dealing with slow performance, and
feeling unable to adapt to new opportunities. This technical debt isn't just a
headache, it’s a roadblock.

My business partner Arnau and I have developed a keen eye for these kinds of
problems over the years. Through our shared experience, we’ve built a working
framework for how to strategically improve a business’s infrastructure with new
technology.

This shared vision and our commitment to a better way of working is what led us
to create Kaidev. Our goal is not just to fix things, but to partner with
businesses, understand their core logic, and work together on a common
objective: turning technical roadblocks into a competitive advantage.

For example, we’ve been partnered with an online tax and business manager in
Australia for over two years, reaching new milestones approximately every six
months. When we started, they were using a mix of off-the-shelf tools like
Formsite, Stripe, and Gmail. The setup worked, but it was slow and costing them
valuable time and money.

Instead of a complete system rebuild, we took a targeted approach. We improved
their Formsite by creating a custom HTML front-end that loads faster and is more
user-friendly. This small change alone doubled their sales. At the same time, we
re-engineered their automated backend processes, as the old system was complex
and costly, cutting their operational costs by 50%

This shows you don't always need to start from scratch. Sometimes, a series of
smart, targeted improvements can unlock significant hidden value.

If you’re ready to stop fighting with your software and start seeing real
results, let’s talk. Book a call with us to discuss your specific challenges and
discover how we can help your business thrive.
