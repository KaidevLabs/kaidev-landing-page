# Welcome to My First Blog Post!

This is some **Markdown content** in my MDX file.

You can write anything here, including:

*   Lists
*   Code blocks:
    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello, MDX!");
    ```
*   And even custom React components!

<CustomComponent text="This is a custom component in MDX!" />

This blog is built using Next.js App Router and MDX. It's a simple, file-based solution.
